/*More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available.
Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.

• Start with your program from Exercise 15.
 Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.

• Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.

• Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
• Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.
